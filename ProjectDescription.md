# Policy-as-Code Framework for Cloud Governance  
**GRC Engineering**

This repository contains a Policy-as-Code (PaC) framework designed to codify security and compliance controls for cloud environments.  
The goal is to turn governance requirements into **automated, testable, enforceable policies** that integrate directly into CI/CD pipelines and cloud workflows.


## Objectives

- Convert compliance frameworks (ISO 27001, SOC 2, CIS Benchmarks, NIST) into enforceable policies.
- Automate control validation.
- Shift GRC to the left by embedding policies in development pipelines.
- Provide scalable templates for multi-account cloud governance.
- Enable real-time decisions, guardrails, and compliance checks.
